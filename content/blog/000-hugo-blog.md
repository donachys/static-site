### Building a website with Hugo

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go (aka golang). It boasts about being super speedy and
how it makes building websites fun again. So far I agree with their claims! The [LiveReload](https://github.com/livereload/livereload-js) feature enabled with `hugo server --watch` is awesome. I often don't even need to reload the web page to see updates and the rebuilds occur on the order of 5-15 ms for _this_ site.

The [theme options](https://themes.gohugo.io/) are plentiful, I have seen many that are ported from jekyll. [HTML5Up](https://html5up.net/) has a lot of themes as well, (including [this one](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-dopetrope/)!) So I can certainly appreciate some assistance from such a fantastic web designer ðŸ˜†.

The only other experience I have with site generators is wordpress from many years ago. Perhaps its because I have more experience than I did then, but I've been able to make much swifter progress with Hugo. I definitely prefer golang templates to PHP, and I feel a lot more comfortable since PHP comes loaded with a lot of _foot-guns_.

After modifying the theme on my own a bit, I'm starting to have a better understanding of how the pieces fit together. I hope to keep iterating and improving on the site ... so more to come as I learn!
