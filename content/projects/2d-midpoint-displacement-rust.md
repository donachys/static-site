### Scenery image generator written in rust

Another project inspired by [a blog post](https://bitesofcode.wordpress.com/2016/12/23/landscape-generation-using-midpoint-displacement/).

I was interested in working with Rust some more and it was an excuse to implement one of my favorite
algorithms: Bresenham's line drawing algorithm.

You can see an example of the output above. Many of the variables are defined as constants in `main.rs`. Try modifying the image size or colors and generate your own scenery. ðŸ˜Ž  The source code is hosted [on github](https://github.com/donachys/midpoint_displacement_2d_terrain).
