      <description>Ludum Dare 44! Two more Ludum Dare gamejams passed which I was unable to participate in. When the third one rolled around and I realized another year had gone by I thought about entering but wasn&amp;rsquo;t very serious about it. That&amp;rsquo;s when @mackcam got in touch about working together for the gamejam. Heck yea, I was in for LD44! I figured this time I would keep a pretty casual attitude about completing our submission.</description>

      <description>Building a game in 72 hours A couple weeks ago after realizing (in shock) that it had been 5 years since my last GameJam, I decided to commit to LD41. For the uninitiated, GameJams are like hackathons for video games where you build a video game over the course of a weekend. Ludum Dare is one of the largest GameJams and it is run 3 times per year by the awesome @pov Mike.</description>

      <description>Building a website with Hugo Hugo is a static site generator written in Go (aka golang). It boasts about being super speedy and how it makes building websites fun again. So far I agree with their claims! The LiveReload feature enabled with hugo server --watch is awesome. I often don&amp;rsquo;t even need to reload the web page to see updates and the rebuilds occur on the order of 5-15 ms for this site.</description>
