        <h2>Dragenvoy - Remix 2018</h2>

<h3 id="nostalgia">Nostalgia</h3>

<p>Looking back over Dragenvoy from 2013 made me disappointed that the unity web player no longer works, and further that I couldn&rsquo;t simply export a new WebGL build with a more recent version of Unity. After getting a bit nostalgic I decided I&rsquo;d like to give Ludum Dare 41 a crack as it is the 5 year anniversary since LD 26 when I made Dragenvoy. I figured it would be good practice to resurrect the old version (if I could.)</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to proceed with getting a 5 year old project to work with today&rsquo;s Unity, but the first thing I knew I needed to do was rip out the 2d framework I was using. Suprisingly, after running Unity&rsquo;s project upgrade tools (after making a backup), then just completely deleting the 2d toolkit folder from my project everything compiled! Wow, I thought it would take much longer just to rip enough pieces out to get a compiling build. Well, let&rsquo;s see what happens when I run it, splash screen worked&hellip; good&hellip; but as soon as I started moving the dragenvoy everything went haywire. Clearly, the physics engine has changed a bit as well.</p>

<h3 id="re-2d">Re-2D</h3>

<p>Since Unity didn&rsquo;t support 2D back in April 2013 I was using another tool to help manage sprites and spritesheets. Rrrrrriiiiipppp &hellip; took that out. All of my game objects were using custom components for managing sprites. I removed the components from all of my prefabs and the gameobjects that start in a blank level like walls and the background. Next, I needed to re-import all of my image assets as 2D sprites using Unity&rsquo;s importing dialogs and reassign them to their respective gameobjects and prefabs.</p>

<p>Unity now also supports 2D physics. Getting rid of that pesky third dimension prevents a whole class of mistakes that I made in my previous version. But now to make use of it I need to re-instrument all of my prefabs and gameobjects with the new components. Fortunately it wasn&rsquo;t too bad. I ran into one puzzling bug where my gameobjects were not reacting to collisions and flying across the screen as I wanted. Turns out this was just a matter of disabling the &lsquo;Is Trigger&rsquo; checkbox on the appropriate gameobjects.</p>

<h3 id="webgl-works">WebGL works!</h3>

<p>At this point I was actually able to start playing a bit. I tweaked a few aspects of the physics simulation and got rid of the pixelated green background to end up with 2018&rsquo;s remixed Dragenvoy. I recall when Unity started experimenting with WebGL back around 2013 and asm.js. I&rsquo;m glad to see it has now become the standard, way to go! After going through this exercise re-familiarizing myself with unity, I feel better prepared and hope that I may actually end up with something playable after LD 41. Looking forward to the theme reveal on April 20th!</p>
