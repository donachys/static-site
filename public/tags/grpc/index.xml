      <description>The libGDX project hosted on github has come a long way since I first encountered it during a gamejam in 2013. Multiple platforms including mobile and desktop are supported and the feature set is great! I wanted to try it out and see if it might be a good choice for me to use during game jams and future game projects. Since Java is a fully-supported language for GRPC, I could use libGDX and GRPC to build a client for cannon-go.</description>

      <description>Designing games is immensely good fun. It&amp;rsquo;s so much fun that I tend to bite off more than I can chew. Previously, I had chatted with @rmbreak about making a clone of the classic gorillas game where players throw explosive bananas at each other. One of the main features being that it is relatively simplistic and we might be able to get to a playable state quickly. Although that project has yet to materialize, the motivations for keeping things simple stuck around.</description>
