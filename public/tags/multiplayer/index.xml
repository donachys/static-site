      <description>The libGDX project hosted on github has come a long way since I first encountered it during a gamejam in 2013. Multiple platforms including mobile and desktop are supported and the feature set is great! I wanted to try it out and see if it might be a good choice for me to use during game jams and future game projects. Since Java is a fully-supported language for GRPC, I could use libGDX and GRPC to build a client for cannon-go.</description>
