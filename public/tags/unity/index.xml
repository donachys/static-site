      <description>10-Year Anniversary Edition! Dragenvoy has enjoyed 10 glorious years on the web. üëèüëèüëè Fans of this famous game will recall that it received an update in 2018 to improve browser compatibility. I thought it would be a good time to make an update to the game ten years after I made it for ludum dare 26 and celebrate the closing of my chapter working at Unity that began many years later.</description>

      <description>Ludum Dare 44! Two more Ludum Dare gamejams passed which I was unable to participate in. When the third one rolled around and I realized another year had gone by I thought about entering but wasn&amp;rsquo;t very serious about it. That&amp;rsquo;s when @mackcam got in touch about working together for the gamejam. Heck yea, I was in for LD44! I figured this time I would keep a pretty casual attitude about completing our submission.</description>

      <description>Building a game in 72 hours A couple weeks ago after realizing (in shock) that it had been 5 years since my last GameJam, I decided to commit to LD41. For the uninitiated, GameJams are like hackathons for video games where you build a video game over the course of a weekend. Ludum Dare is one of the largest GameJams and it is run 3 times per year by the awesome @pov Mike.</description>

      <description>Nostalgia Looking back over Dragenvoy from 2013 made me disappointed that the unity web player no longer works, and further that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t simply export a new WebGL build with a more recent version of Unity. After getting a bit nostalgic I decided I&amp;rsquo;d like to give Ludum Dare 41 a crack as it is the 5 year anniversary since LD 26 when I made Dragenvoy. I figured it would be good practice to resurrect the old version (if I could.</description>
